Forge File Manager: Forge your path through the filesystem. (Command, Craft and Control. Built for builders.)

# Conceptual Philosophy

* Crafting & Customization: Just like blacksmiths forge tools, users can forge their workflow ‚Äî customizable keybindings, plugins, macros.
* Power & Precision: Command-driven, no-nonsense interface with powerful features.
* Automation & Scripting: Hooks into powershell scripts, supports batch operations, file processing.
* Resilience: Built to handle large directory trees, symbolic links, git status, etc.
* Integration: Can "forge" links with other tools (git, fzf, bat, etc.).
* Template-based Creation: Create files or folders from templates (e.g., boilerplate code).


Colors: Dark backgrounds with ember/orange highlights (to reflect molten metal & heat).
